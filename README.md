## 2. What did I do?
I struggled a lot as there were some problems that popped up here and there, I guess there is a lot of code that is wrong somewhere.

I googled a lot, also asked my friends a bit about this, and also your tips. I just took all the tips I could get. I didn't have time to finish the other pages but if I can now I will finish everything
